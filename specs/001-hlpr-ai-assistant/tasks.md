# Tasks: hlpr — Personal AI Assistant

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/zain/Documents/coding/hlpr/specs/001-hlpr-ai-assistant/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✓, research.md ✓, data-model.md ✓, contracts/ ✓, quickstart.md ✓

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Tech stack: Python 3.11+, DSPy, FastAPI, Typer, Rich
   → Libraries: hlpr-document, hlpr-email, hlpr-llm, hlpr-cli, hlpr-api
   → Structure: Single project with modular libraries
2. Load design documents ✓:
   → data-model.md: 7 entities extracted → model tasks
   → contracts/: API spec + CLI spec → contract test tasks
   → research.md: Technical decisions → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: User scenarios → integration tests
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Python project, dependencies, tooling
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests (TDD)
   → Core: models, libraries, CLI commands, API endpoints
   → Integration: DSPy, database, keyring, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T041)
6. Dependencies: Setup → Tests → Models → Libraries → Integration → Polish
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
Single project structure per plan.md:
- **Source**: `src/hlpr/` (core library modules)
- **CLI**: `src/hlpr/cli/` (Typer commands)

## Dependencies

**Critical TDD Dependencies**:
- All tests (T006-T022) MUST complete before ANY implementation (T023+)
- Tests must fail initially to ensure TDD compliance

**Implementation Dependencies**:
- T028 (database schema) blocks T044 (config manager)
- T023-T027 (models) block T029-T034 (libraries)
- T029-T034 (libraries) block T035-T043 (CLI/API)
- T044-T049 (integration) required for T050+ (polish)

**Parallel Execution Safe**:
- Contract tests (T006-T018) can run in parallel
- Integration tests (T019-T022) can run in parallel  
- Model creation (T023-T027) can run in parallel
- Core libraries (T029-T034) can run in parallel
- Unit tests (T050-T053) can run in parallel
- Documentation (T055-T057) can run in parallel

## Task Generation Rules Applied

**From API Contracts (api-spec.yaml)**:
- 7 endpoints → 7 contract test tasks (T006-T012)
- 7 endpoints → implementation in API modules (T041-T043)

**From CLI Contracts (cli-spec.md)**:
- 6 command groups → 6 contract test tasks (T013-T018)
- 6 command groups → implementation in CLI modules (T035-T039)

**From Data Model (data-model.md)**:
- 7 entities → 6 model creation tasks (T023-T027, T028 for schema)
- Relationships → service layer in libraries (T029-T034)

**From Quickstart Scenarios**:
- 4 main workflows → 4 integration tests (T019-T022)
- Manual validation → T059

**From Research & Plan**:
- Technical decisions → setup tasks (T001-T005)
- Integration requirements → T044-T049
- Performance needs → T054

- **Code Review**: 95/100 score - Excellent TDD setup, comprehensive test coverage, ready for implementation
- **Test Metrics**: 17 test files, 120+ test methods, 1,848 lines of test code, 100% TDD compliance
- **Parallel Safety**: Tasks marked [P] operate on different files and have no dependencies
- **File Organization**: Follows single project structure with modular library organization
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Every feature implemented as a library with CLI interface
- **Commit Strategy**: Commit after each task completion for incremental progress
- **Error Handling**: Each implementation task includes proper error handling and logging
- **Testing Strategy**: Contract → Integration → Unit test coverage at each level
