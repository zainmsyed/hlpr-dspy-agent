# Feature Specification: Core Configuration and UI Management System

**Feature Branch**: `005-core-configuration-ui`  
**Created**: September 25, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Feature 005: Core Configuration and UI Management System - Centralized config system with UI strings externalization, configuration reset safety, and schema validation for platform-wide defaults and limits"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Centralized configuration system with UI externalization and safety features
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: developers, end users; Actions: configure, validate, reset, localize
   → Data: configuration settings, UI strings, defaults, limits
   → Constraints: single source of truth, corruption recovery, schema validation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Configuration storage location and format specified in source document
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flows for configuration management and recovery
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → All requirements are testable based on source specifications
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Configuration schemas, UI strings, validation rules
7. Run Review Checklist
   → No ambiguities remain, implementation details avoided
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Stories

**Developer Story**: As a developer working on the hlpr platform, I need a centralized configuration management system that provides consistent defaults across all modules, allows for safe configuration changes and recovery, and supports externalized UI strings for maintainability and future localization.

**End User Story**: As an end user of hlpr, I need the system to work reliably with sensible defaults, recover gracefully from configuration issues, and provide clear error messages when something goes wrong.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh installation, **When** the application starts, **Then** all modules use consistent provider defaults (local, openai, anthropic, groq, together), format options (rich, txt, md, json), and chunk size limits from a single source
2. **Given** a corrupted configuration file, **When** the application starts, **Then** the system automatically falls back to safe defaults, logs the recovery action with timestamp and corruption details, and continues operation
3. **Given** a developer needs to change UI text, **When** they update externalized UI strings in the centralized location, **Then** all CLI interfaces (guided mode, batch processing, error messages) reflect the changes without code modifications
4. **Given** invalid configuration values are provided (e.g., negative chunk sizes, unsupported providers), **When** the system validates the config, **Then** clear error messages guide users to correct values with specific examples
5. **Given** a user wants to reset their configuration, **When** they trigger a config reset via CLI command, **Then** the system safely restores factory defaults while preserving user data and saved command templates
6. **Given** environment variables override default values, **When** the application loads configuration, **Then** the override precedence follows: user config > environment variables > system defaults
7. **Given** the system detects missing UI string references, **When** loading the configuration, **Then** it reports broken references with specific identifiers and falls back to default messages

### Edge Cases
- What happens when configuration file permissions are incorrect (e.g., read-only, owned by different user)?
- How does the system handle partial configuration corruption (e.g., malformed JSON, missing required fields)?
- What occurs when UI string references are broken or missing (e.g., deleted string keys, malformed string files)?
- How does the system behave when default values exceed system limits (e.g., chunk size larger than memory limit)?
- What happens when environment variables contain invalid values (e.g., non-numeric timeout, unsupported provider names)?
- How does the system handle concurrent access to configuration files during updates?
- What occurs when disk space is insufficient for configuration backup during reset?
- How does the system behave on different platforms (Windows vs Linux permission models)?
- What happens when the configuration directory doesn't exist or isn't writable?
- How does the system handle version conflicts between old and new configuration schemas?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a single source of truth for all provider defaults (local, openai, anthropic, groq, together)
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain consistent format options and limits across all CLI commands
- **FR-003**: System MUST externalize all user-facing strings from CLI modules for maintainability
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate configuration schemas on application startup
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically recover from configuration corruption by falling back to safe defaults
- **FR-006**: System MUST log all configuration recovery actions for debugging
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a configuration reset mechanism that preserves user data
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate UI string referential integrity to prevent broken references
- **FR-009**: System MUST support override precedence (user config > environment > defaults)
- **FR-010**: Configuration validation MUST provide actionable error messages for invalid values
- **FR-011**: System MUST support chunk size limits and provider-specific constraints
- **FR-012**: UI string system MUST support structured organization for future localization
- **FR-013**: Configuration loading MUST complete in under 100ms for normal startup performance
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility when adding new configuration options
- **FR-015**: Configuration schema validation MUST support version migration for future config format changes
- **FR-016**: Platform constants MUST be accessible from all modules without circular imports
- **FR-017**: System MUST support both file-based and environment-based configuration sources
- **FR-018**: Configuration reset MUST preserve critical user data including saved command templates and preferences
- **FR-019**: UI string loading MUST fail gracefully with fallback messages when resources are missing

### Key Entities
- **PlatformConfig**: Central configuration container with provider defaults (local, openai, anthropic, groq, together), format options (rich, txt, md, json), chunk sizes (8192 default, 32768 max), and system limits
- **UIStrings**: Externalized string resources organized by module and context (errors, prompts, help text, validation messages) with referential integrity checking
- **ConfigValidator**: Schema validation engine that ensures configuration integrity, validates provider/format combinations, and provides structured error reporting with actionable guidance
- **ConfigRecovery**: Recovery system that handles corruption detection, atomic fallback mechanisms, detailed logging, and preserves user data during reset operations
- **PlatformConstants**: Immutable constants and loaders exported from `config/platform.py` to replace scattered defaults across modules
- **ConfigLoader**: Unified loader that handles override precedence (user > environment > defaults) and version migration
