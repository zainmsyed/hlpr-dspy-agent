# Research: Enhanced CLI/TUI for Document Summarization

## Research Tasks Completed

### Rich Framework Integration
**Decision**: Use Rich directly for progress bars, panels, tables, and formatted output  
**Rationale**: Rich provides comprehensive terminal formatting with minimal setup, excellent progress indicators, and beautiful panel-based output that matches PRD requirements  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Click (less rich output capabilities)
- Plain terminal output (doesn't meet "beautiful CLI" requirement)
- Custom formatting (reinventing the wheel)

### Typer CLI Framework  
**Decision**: Enhance existing Typer commands rather than replacing CLI structure  
**Rationale**: Project already uses Typer effectively, need to add interactive guided mode while preserving existing direct command patterns  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Click (would require major refactoring)
- argparse (too basic for interactive requirements)
- Complete CLI rewrite (unnecessary disruption)

### Interactive Mode Implementation
**Decision**: Use typer.prompt() and rich.prompt.Prompt for guided interactions  
**Rationale**: Native Typer prompting with Rich styling provides consistent UX, proper validation, and beautiful presentation  
**Alternatives considered**:
- questionary (external dependency)
- inquirer (less maintained)
- Custom prompt system (unnecessary complexity)

### File Selection Patterns
**Decision**: Support both file paths and glob patterns with rich.table for multi-file display  
**Rationale**: Power users need glob support, guided users need file browser-like experience via rich tables  
**Alternatives considered**:
- File dialog widgets (not CLI-appropriate)
- Simple list display (less user-friendly)
- Directory traversal UI (too complex for CLI)

### Progress Display Strategy
**Decision**: Rich.Progress with SpinnerColumn, TextColumn, BarColumn, and TimeElapsedColumn  
**Rationale**: Provides phase-aware progress (parsing → chunking → summarizing) with time estimates  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple spinner (insufficient detail)
- Console print updates (not visually appealing)
- tqdm (Rich integration is better)

### Error Handling Approach
**Decision**: Rich panels for errors with actionable suggestions and color-coded severity  
**Rationale**: Matches constitution requirement for clear error messages, provides visual hierarchy  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Plain text errors (doesn't meet beautiful CLI requirement)
- Exception bubbling (poor user experience)
- Log-only errors (not user-friendly)

### Configuration Override Strategy
**Decision**: CLI flags override config file, display active config in verbose mode using Rich tables  
**Rationale**: Standard CLI behavior, transparency for debugging, visual confirmation of settings  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Config file precedence (unexpected CLI behavior)
- No override capability (inflexible)
- Merge strategies (overly complex)

### Batch Processing Design
**Decision**: Accept multiple file arguments and glob patterns, process in parallel where possible  
**Rationale**: Power user efficiency requirement, natural CLI pattern  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Single file only (doesn't meet FR-006)
- Sequential processing only (slow for large batches)
- Complex queuing system (over-engineering)

### Output Format Architecture
**Decision**: Format-specific renderers (RichRenderer, JsonRenderer, MarkdownRenderer, PlainTextRenderer)  
**Rationale**: Clean separation of concerns, extensible for future formats, testable  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Single formatter with conditionals (not maintainable)
- Template-based system (overkill for this use case)
- External template engine (unnecessary dependency)

### Interruption Handling
**Decision**: Use signal handlers to catch Ctrl+C, save partial results with Rich confirmation prompts  
**Rationale**: Professional CLI behavior, user data protection, clear feedback  
**Alternatives considered**:
- No interruption support (poor user experience)
- Silent cleanup (user confusion)
- Immediate termination (data loss risk)

## Architecture Decisions

### Module Structure
```
src/hlpr/cli/
├── interactive.py      # Guided mode prompts and workflows
├── rich_display.py     # Rich formatting, panels, progress bars
├── validators.py       # Input validation with rich error messages
├── batch.py           # Multi-file processing logic
└── renderers.py       # Output format renderers
```

### Key Classes and Functions
- `InteractiveSession`: Manages guided mode workflow
- `RichDisplay`: Handles all Rich-based output formatting
- `ProgressTracker`: Wraps Rich.Progress for phase-aware tracking  
- `FileValidator`: Validates file inputs with rich error reporting
- `BatchProcessor`: Handles multiple file operations
- `OutputRenderer`: Base class for format-specific output

### Integration Points
- Extends existing `hlpr.cli.summarize` module
- Uses existing `hlpr.document.summarizer` unchanged
- Leverages existing `hlpr.config` for settings
- Integrates with `hlpr.logging_utils` for structured logging

## Technical Dependencies

### New Dependencies
- No new dependencies required (Rich and Typer already in project)

### Existing Dependencies Leveraged
- `rich`: Progress bars, panels, tables, prompts, console formatting
- `typer`: CLI structure, argument parsing, prompts
- `pathlib`: File system operations  
- `pydantic`: Configuration and data validation
- `logging`: Structured logging integration

## Performance Considerations

### Startup Time
- Lazy import of Rich components to reduce initialization overhead
- Minimal overhead for direct command mode (power users)
- Interactive mode startup acceptable trade-off for guided experience

### Memory Usage  
- Rich components are lightweight for terminal output
- No significant memory overhead beyond existing summarization logic
- Progress tracking uses minimal state

### Large File Handling
- Progress reporting doesn't impact processing performance
- Rich panels handle long text with proper wrapping
- Chunked processing remains unchanged, just with better progress feedback

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Rich integration (well-established, stable library)
- Typer enhancements (extending existing successful pattern)
- File validation (straightforward implementation)

### Medium Risk
- Interactive mode UX (needs user testing for optimal flow)
- Batch processing parallelization (complexity in error handling)
- Progress estimation accuracy (depends on processing characteristics)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental rollout starting with enhanced direct commands
- Comprehensive contract tests for all interaction modes
- Fallback to basic output if Rich formatting fails

## Conclusion

All technical unknowns resolved. Implementation approach uses existing, proven technologies within the project's established architecture. No constitutional violations identified. Ready to proceed to Phase 1 design.
