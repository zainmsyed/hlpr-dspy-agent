# Feature Specification: Enhanced CLI/TUI for Document Summarization

**Feature Branch**: `003-cli-tui-of`  
**Created**: September 18, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "cli/tui of the documents summarization"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature focuses on improving CLI/TUI experience for document summarization
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: CLI interaction patterns, TUI components, user experience workflows
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Interactive mode behaviors defined based on PRD requirements
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary flows: guided mode, power user mode, error handling
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement addresses CLI/TUI experience improvements
6. Identify Key Entities
   → CLI commands, interactive prompts, progress displays, output formats
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Requirements focus on user experience, not implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user working with personal documents, I want an intuitive and beautiful command-line interface that guides me through document summarization tasks while also providing efficient shortcuts for power users, so I can quickly understand and process my documents without being overwhelmed by complex options.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Guided Mode (Interactive)
1. **Given** a user runs `hlpr summarize` without arguments, **When** they interact with the guided prompts, **Then** the system walks them through file selection, provider choice, and output preferences with clear visual feedback
2. **Given** a user selects a document file through guided mode, **When** processing begins, **Then** they see a beautiful progress indicator with processing phases and estimated completion
3. **Given** document processing completes successfully, **When** results are displayed, **Then** the summary appears in a formatted panel with key points highlighted and metadata clearly presented

#### Power User Mode (Direct Commands)
1. **Given** an experienced user runs `hlpr summarize document myfile.pdf --provider local --format json`, **When** the command executes, **Then** processing occurs immediately with concise progress feedback and structured output
2. **Given** a user specifies custom parameters like `--temperature 0.0 --chunk-size 4096`, **When** summarization runs, **Then** the system respects all parameters and displays relevant configuration in verbose mode
3. **Given** a user wants to save output with `--save --output summary.md`, **When** processing completes, **Then** the file is saved in the specified format with confirmation message

#### Error Handling & User Guidance
1. **Given** a user provides an invalid file path, **When** the command runs, **Then** they receive a clear, actionable error message with suggestions
2. **Given** a user selects an unsupported file format, **When** validation occurs, **Then** they see supported formats listed with guidance on conversion options
3. **Given** processing fails due to provider issues, **When** fallback is available, **Then** the user is informed of the fallback with option to retry or continue

### Edge Cases
- What happens when processing very large files (>100MB)? System shows chunking strategy and progress per chunk
- How does the system handle network timeouts with cloud providers? Clear timeout messaging with option to switch to local provider
- What if the user interrupts processing with Ctrl+C? Graceful cleanup with partial results saved if possible
- How are configuration conflicts handled between CLI flags and config file settings? CLI flags take precedence with clear indication

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Interactive Experience
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a guided interactive mode accessible via `hlpr summarize` that walks users through document selection, provider choice, and output preferences
- **FR-002**: System MUST display real-time progress indicators using Rich progress bars showing current processing phase (parsing, chunking, summarizing)
- **FR-003**: System MUST present summaries using Rich panels with color-coded sections for main summary, key points, and metadata
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide contextual help and command suggestions when users make errors or need guidance

#### Power User Efficiency
- **FR-005**: System MUST support direct command execution with `hlpr summarize document <file>` accepting all configuration options as flags
- **FR-006**: System MUST enable batch processing workflows where users can specify multiple files or use shell patterns
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide verbose mode (`--verbose`) that shows detailed processing information including chunking decisions and model parameters
- **FR-008**: System MUST support output redirection and piping for integration with other command-line tools

#### Output & Display Management
- **FR-009**: System MUST offer multiple output formats (rich terminal display, plain text, markdown, JSON) selectable via `--format` flag
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to save summaries to files with automatic filename generation or custom paths via `--output`
- **FR-011**: System MUST display processing metadata including file information, model used, processing time, and configuration parameters
- **FR-012**: System MUST truncate or paginate very long outputs in terminal while offering full output in saved files

#### Error Handling & Recovery
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate input files before processing and provide clear error messages for common issues (file not found, unsupported format, permissions)
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle processing failures gracefully with informative error messages and suggested recovery actions
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide fallback options when primary processing methods fail (e.g., cloud provider timeout → local provider)
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow users to interrupt long-running operations cleanly with Ctrl+C while preserving partial results when possible

#### Configuration & Customization
- **FR-017**: System MUST respect user configuration from config files while allowing CLI flags to override settings for individual operations
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide configuration commands to set defaults for provider, model, output format, and processing parameters
- **FR-019**: System MUST validate configuration parameters and provide helpful error messages for invalid values (e.g., temperature out of range)
- **FR-020**: System MUST support provider-specific options and validate them against the selected provider's capabilities

### Key Entities

- **CLI Command Structure**: Hierarchical commands (`hlpr summarize document`) with consistent option patterns across subcommands
- **Interactive Session**: Guided workflow with prompts for file selection, provider configuration, and output preferences  
- **Progress Display**: Rich-based progress indicators showing parsing, chunking, and summarization phases with estimated completion
- **Output Panels**: Formatted display containers for summaries, key points, metadata, and error messages using Rich styling
- **Configuration Context**: User preferences and settings that influence CLI behavior and can be overridden per-command
- **Error Response System**: Structured error handling with clear messages, suggested actions, and graceful degradation options
