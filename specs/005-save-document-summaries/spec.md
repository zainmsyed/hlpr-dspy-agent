# Feature Specification: Save Document Summaries in Organized Folder Structure

**Feature Branch**: `005-save-document-summaries`  
**Created**: September 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Save document summaries in hlpr/summaries/documents"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Organize document summary storage in dedicated folder structure
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: CLI users processing documents
   ‚Üí Actions: Save summaries to organized folders
   ‚Üí Data: Document summaries, metadata, file paths
   ‚Üí Constraints: Maintain backward compatibility, automatic folder creation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Base directory location resolved (relative to working directory)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: process document ‚Üí save summary ‚Üí find in organized location
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements testable via CLI commands and file system verification
6. Identify Key Entities: Document summaries, folder structure, output preferences
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details, focused on user experience
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: When a user specifies `--output /custom/path/file.txt`, should the system still create the organized folder structure or respect the exact custom path? ‚Üí A: Use custom path exactly as specified, bypass organized structure

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user processes multiple documents for summarization throughout their work session. Instead of having summary files scattered in various locations or cluttering their working directory, they want all summaries automatically organized in a predictable folder structure (`hlpr/summaries/documents/`) where they can easily find, review, and manage their processed content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has a document to summarize, **When** they run `hlpr summarize document file.pdf --save`, **Then** the summary is automatically saved to `hlpr/summaries/documents/file_summary.txt` with the folder structure created if it doesn't exist
2. **Given** the `hlpr/summaries/documents/` folder already exists with previous summaries, **When** a user saves a new summary, **Then** the new file is added to the existing folder without affecting previous summaries
3. **Given** a user processes multiple documents in a batch, **When** they use the save option, **Then** all summaries are organized in the same `hlpr/summaries/documents/` folder for easy access
4. **Given** a user wants to find their previously generated summaries, **When** they navigate to the working directory, **Then** they can find the `hlpr/summaries/documents/` folder containing all their organized summary files
5. **Given** a user specifies a custom output path with `--output /my/custom/path.md`, **When** they run the summarize command, **Then** the summary is saved to the exact specified path without creating the organized folder structure

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the file system permissions prevent folder creation?
- How does the system handle existing files with the same name in the target folder?
- What happens when the custom output path directory doesn't exist?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically create `hlpr/summaries/documents/` folder structure relative to the current working directory when saving summaries
- **FR-002**: System MUST save all document summaries to the `hlpr/summaries/documents/` folder by default when the `--save` option is used
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve existing filename generation patterns (e.g., `{document_name}_summary.{format}`) within the organized folder structure
- **FR-004**: System MUST respect exact custom paths when `--output` parameter is specified, bypassing the organized folder structure completely
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle folder creation gracefully, providing clear error messages if directory creation fails due to permissions or disk space
- **FR-006**: System MUST warn users before overwriting existing summary files in the organized folder structure
- **FR-007**: System MUST support all existing output formats (txt, md, json) within the organized folder structure
- **FR-008**: Default file format it is saved in is MD

### Key Entities
- **Document Summary**: Generated text content with metadata, saved as files in various formats (txt, md, json)
- **Folder Structure**: Organized directory hierarchy (`hlpr/summaries/documents/`) for storing and categorizing summary files
- **Output Preferences**: User settings and CLI options that control where and how summaries are saved
