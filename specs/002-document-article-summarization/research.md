# Research: Document & Article Summarization

## DSPy Integration for Document Summarization

**Decision**: Use DSPy 2.4+ with MIPRO optimizer for document summarization pipeline
**Rationale**: 
- DSPy provides structured approach to LLM pipeline optimization for summarization tasks
- MIPRO enables automatic prompt refinement for document processing
- Built-in support for multiple LLM backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, local)
- Allows systematic evaluation and improvement of summarization workflows

**Alternatives considered**:
- LangChain: More heavyweight, less focused on optimization
- Direct LLM API calls: No optimization capabilities, more manual prompt engineering
- Haystack: Primarily for search/QA, not optimized for summarization

## Document Parsing Strategy

**Decision**: Specialized libraries for different formats with fallback handling
**Rationale**:
- PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction (simple, reliable for text-based PDFs)
- python-docx for DOCX files (standard library for Word documents)
- Built-in text/markdown handling (no additional dependencies)
- Clear error messages for unsupported formats (scanned PDFs, encrypted files)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Unstructured.io: Heavyweight, includes OCR which is out of scope
- pymupdf: More complex, includes rendering features we don't need
- pandoc: External dependency, format conversion rather than parsing

## Chunking Strategy for Large Documents

**Decision**: Hierarchical chunking with configurable parameters and overlap
**Rationale**:
- Default 8192 tokens per chunk with 256 token overlap
- Process chunks individually, then summarize the summaries
- Configurable via CLI flags for different model context windows
- Preserves document structure better than simple splitting

**Alternatives considered**:
- Fixed-size splitting: Loses semantic coherence
- Paragraph-based chunking: Inconsistent sizes for token limits
- Sentence-based chunking: Too granular for long documents

## LLM Provider Integration

**Decision**: HTTP-based integration with support for local and cloud providers
**Rationale**:
- Ollama-compatible API for local LLMs (default: http://localhost:11434)
- Direct API integration for OpenAI/Anthropic
- Unified interface for runtime provider switching
- Secure API key handling for cloud providers

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct llama.cpp integration: Requires model management, GPU handling
- Hugging Face Transformers: Memory intensive for personal use
- vLLM server: More complex setup for single-user scenarios

## Output Formatting Strategy

**Decision**: Rich terminal output with file export options
**Rationale**:
- Rich library for beautiful CLI display with syntax highlighting
- Support for multiple output formats (TXT, MD, JSON)
- Progress bars for long-running operations
- Structured data for programmatic use

**Alternatives considered**:
- Plain text output: Less user-friendly
- HTML output: Overkill for CLI tool
- Fixed format only: Less flexible for different use cases

## Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Streaming processing and async operations where possible
**Rationale**:
- Stream large file processing to show progress
- Async LLM requests for better responsiveness
- Caching of processed results to avoid re-processing
- Smart chunking to minimize API calls

**Optimization Techniques**:
- Rich progress bars for long operations
- Concurrent processing of independent chunks
- Result caching with content hashing
- Memory-efficient file processing

## Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Graceful degradation with clear error messages
**Rationale**:
- Validate file formats before processing
- Provide specific error messages for different failure modes
- Fallback to simpler processing when advanced features fail
- Structured error responses for API consumers

**Error Scenarios Handled**:
- Unsupported file formats
- Corrupted or inaccessible files
- LLM service unavailability
- Network timeouts
- Memory constraints for large files

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-level testing with real dependencies for integration tests
**Rationale**:
- Contract tests for CLI and API interfaces
- Integration tests with actual LLM endpoints
- Unit tests for parsing and utility functions
- Sample documents for realistic testing scenarios

**Test Environment Setup**:
- Mock local LLM server for consistent testing
- Test documents in multiple formats
- Isolated test configuration
- Performance benchmarks for regression testing
