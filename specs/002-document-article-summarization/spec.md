# Feature Specification: Document & Article Summarization

**Feature Branch**: `002-document-article-summarization`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Document & Article Summarization: Support summarizing PDF, DOCX, TXT, and MD files using DSPy/MIPRO with local and cloud LLMs, output to CLI or file or API."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a knowledge worker managing personal documents and articles, I want to quickly summarize PDF, DOCX, TXT, and MD files using AI so that I can understand key points without reading the entire content, with options to display in CLI, save to file, or access via API.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a PDF document on my computer, **When** I run the summarization command with the file path, **Then** the system displays a concise summary with key points and offers to save it in MD or TXT format.

2. **Given** I have a DOCX article file, **When** I provide it to the summarization feature, **Then** the system extracts text content and generates an accurate summary using the configured LLM.

3. **Given** I have a large document that exceeds token limits, **When** I request summarization, **Then** the system chunks the content appropriately and produces a coherent aggregated summary.

4. **Given** I want programmatic access, **When** I use the API endpoint with a file upload, **Then** I receive a structured JSON response with the summary and metadata.

5. **Given** I have configured a local LLM, **When** I run summarization, **Then** all processing happens locally without sending data to cloud providers.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a PDF is scanned (image-only) and cannot be processed for text extraction?
- How does the system handle unsupported file formats or corrupted files?
- What occurs when the LLM endpoint is unavailable or returns errors?
- How are very large files (>100MB) handled in terms of performance and memory?
- What happens when the summary output exceeds display limits in CLI?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept PDF, DOCX, TXT, and MD files for summarization and validate file formats before processing.

- **FR-002**: System MUST extract text content from supported file formats and handle plain text extraction (OCR for scanned PDFs is out of scope).

- **FR-003**: System MUST generate concise, accurate summaries using DSPy/MIPRO optimization for the configured LLM provider.

- **FR-004**: System MUST support both local LLM endpoints (e.g., HTTP API) and cloud LLM providers with runtime selection.

- **FR-005**: System MUST provide output options: display in CLI with Rich formatting, save to file (TXT/MD), or return via API as JSON.

- **FR-006**: System MUST handle large documents by chunking content to stay within model context windows and aggregating summaries effectively.

- **FR-007**: System MUST validate input files and return clear error messages for unsupported formats, unreadable files, or processing failures.

- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure privacy by defaulting to local processing and clearly communicating data flow when using cloud providers.

- **FR-009**: System MUST provide progress indicators during processing of large files.

- **FR-010**: System MUST support both guided mode for beginners and direct command execution for experienced users.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Document**: Represents a file for summarization. Attributes: file path, format type, size, extracted text content, generated summary, processing metadata.
