# Feature Specification: Update Config Workflow

**Feature Branch**: `007-update-config-workflow`  
**Created**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "update config workflow"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚úÖ Parsed: Configuration management system for user preferences and API keys
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚úÖ Identified: users, configuration management, preferences persistence, API keys, guided setup
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚úÖ No unclear aspects - requirements clarified through conversation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚úÖ Clear user flow identified: first-run setup, ongoing preference management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚úÖ Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚úÖ Configuration, API keys, user preferences identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚úÖ No implementation details, focused on user needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: What level of file security is needed for API key protection? ‚Üí A: Basic user-only read/write (chmod 600) - sufficient for single-user systems
- Q: What should the system behavior be for configuration errors? ‚Üí A: Graceful fallback - use default values for invalid settings, warn user, and offer choice to fix or continue
- Q: How fast should configuration loading and saving be for good user experience? ‚Üí A: Instant (under 100ms) - configuration operations should be imperceptible

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the hlpr application, I want to set up my preferences once and have them remembered across sessions, so that I don't need to repeatedly select the same AI provider, output format, and enter API keys every time I use the application.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user runs hlpr for the first time, **When** they execute any summarization command, **Then** the system prompts them to set up their preferences through a guided workflow
2. **Given** a user has completed initial setup, **When** they run summarization commands, **Then** the system uses their saved preferences as defaults without prompting
3. **Given** a user wants to change their preferences, **When** they run the config command, **Then** they can update their settings through a guided interface
4. **Given** a user selects a cloud AI provider, **When** they don't have an API key configured, **Then** the system shows a clear error message with instructions on how to add their API key
5. **Given** a user has saved configuration files, **When** they want to make advanced changes, **Then** they can directly edit the configuration files with clear guidance
6. **Given** a user wants to reset their configuration, **When** they use the reset option, **Then** the system returns to default settings and removes saved preferences

### Edge Cases
- What happens when configuration files become corrupted or have invalid values? System uses default values, warns user, and offers choice to continue with defaults or fix configuration
- How does the system handle missing API keys for selected cloud providers?
- What occurs when a user tries to edit configuration files incorrectly?
- How does the system behave when configuration files exist but are incomplete?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a guided configuration setup on first run that prompts users for essential preferences
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist user preferences including default AI provider, output format, and advanced settings between sessions
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a dedicated configuration command that allows users to modify their preferences
- **FR-004**: System MUST store API keys securely in a separate environment file with appropriate file permissions
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear placeholder examples in configuration files to guide manual editing
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate configuration values, use default values for invalid settings, warn users of configuration issues, and offer choice to continue or fix configuration
- **FR-007**: System MUST load user preferences as defaults for all operations while still allowing command-line overrides
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a configuration display command that shows current settings without revealing sensitive information
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a configuration reset command that restores default settings
- **FR-010**: System MUST detect when required API keys are missing and provide clear guidance on how to obtain and configure them
- **FR-011**: System MUST create configuration files with appropriate permissions: .env files with chmod 600 (API keys), config.yaml with chmod 644 (user preferences)
- **FR-012**: Users MUST be able to edit configuration files directly using any text editor

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Configuration**: Represents user preferences including default provider, output format, temperature settings, and file processing options
- **API Credentials**: Stores sensitive authentication information for cloud AI providers in a secure format
- **Configuration Files**: File-based storage for user preferences with human-readable format and helpful comments

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Configuration loading MUST complete within 100ms for imperceptible user experience
- **NFR-002**: Configuration saving MUST complete within 100ms to avoid workflow interruption
- **NFR-003**: Configuration files MUST remain under 1MB to ensure fast loading performance
