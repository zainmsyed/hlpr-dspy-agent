# Feature Specification: Interactive save prompt (Rich)

**Feature Branch**: `006-title-interactive-save`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add interactive 'save summary' prompts using rich.prompt when --save is not provided: confirm save (default yes), choose format (md/txt/json default md), destination path default to existing default output path, use atomic_write_text from hlpr.io.atomic, include JSON save option with generated_at timestamp, auto-save defaults when non-interactive, and add unit tests and docs."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user who runs `hlpr summarize document <file>` interactively (no `--save` flag), I want to be prompted after the summary is displayed to save the summary so I can choose whether to persist it, pick the format, and select the destination path using sensible defaults.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an interactive terminal and no `--save` flag, **When** the summary is displayed, **Then** the CLI prompts: "Would you like to save the summary? (yes/no) [Y]: " with default Yes. If the user accepts (presses Enter or types yes), the CLI then prompts for format (md/txt/json) with default `md`, then prompts for destination path with a sensible default (existing default output path), and finally saves the file atomically and prints the saved path.
2. **Given** an interactive terminal and the user responds `no` to the save prompt, **When** the user declines, **Then** the CLI prints a short message (e.g., "Summary not saved.") and exits without writing a file.
3. **Given** a non-interactive environment (stdin not a TTY) and no `--save` flag, **When** the command runs, **Then** the CLI does not prompt and does not save (privacy-first). To enable auto-save in non-interactive contexts, use `--save` flag or set `HLPR_AUTO_SAVE=true` environment variable.
4. **Given** the user selects `json` format, **When** the save is performed, **Then** the saved JSON file contains at least `summary` and `generated_at` (ISO8601) fields and is written atomically.

### Edge Cases
- User provides invalid format input (e.g., "markdwn"): CLI reprompts and shows supported choices.
- Destination directory does not exist: CLI attempts to create directories (mkdir -p). If creation fails due to permissions, the CLI prints an error and does not crash.
- File already exists: CLI will avoid overwriting by appending a timestamp suffix to the filename (e.g., `_20250929T153000`) to preserve the existing file and produce a unique output path.
- Non-interactive environment but output path points to read-only filesystem: CLI should raise a StorageError with helpful details.
- When atomic write helper fails at OS-level, fallback to a best-effort write should be attempted, but an error will be surfaced if that also fails.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: When `hlpr summarize document` or `hlpr summarize meeting` is run without `--save`, the CLI MUST prompt the user to confirm whether they want to save the summary, using Rich's prompt module (`rich.prompt.Confirm`) with default Yes.
- **FR-002**: If the user confirms, the CLI MUST prompt for the save format using `rich.prompt.Prompt` with choices [`md`, `txt`, `json`] and default `md`. The input must be validated and the prompt repeated on invalid input.
- **FR-003**: If the user confirms, the CLI MUST prompt for a destination path using `rich.prompt.Prompt` with default set to the organized storage path from `prefs.to_organized_storage().get_organized_path(document.path, format)` (fallback to `_determine_output_path` if organized storage not configured). If the directory does not exist, the CLI MUST attempt to create it.
- **FR-004**: The CLI MUST use `hlpr.io.atomic.atomic_write_text` to persist the file atomically. If JSON format is chosen, the CLI MUST include a `generated_at` ISO8601 timestamp alongside the `summary` field.
- **FR-005**: In non-interactive contexts (stdin is not a TTY), the CLI MUST not block on prompts. Auto-save is opt-in only via explicit `--save` flag or `HLPR_AUTO_SAVE=true` environment variable to preserve privacy-first design. This behavior must be documented and testable.
- **FR-006**: All errors during saving (permission errors, disk space) MUST be surfaced as `StorageError` with helpful details; the CLI should print a user-friendly error message and exit with an appropriate exit code.

*Clarifications / optional behavior*:
- **FR-007**: When the computed destination file already exists, the CLI MUST avoid overwriting by appending a timestamp suffix to the filename (format `_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS`, e.g. `_20250929T153000`) to produce a unique output path. This ensures previously saved summaries are preserved by default.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29

- Q: When the destination file already exists, which behavior should the CLI use? ‚Üí A: C (avoid overwriting by appending timestamp suffix to filename)

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **SavedSummary**: Represents a summary saved to disk with attributes: path (filesystem location), format (md/txt/json), generated_at (ISO8601 timestamp), summary (text content), source_file (original document name)

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [ ] Focused on user value and why this prompt exists
- [ ] Minimal implementation detail but references to Rich prompt module are acceptable because this spec intentionally guides UI behavior
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No unresolved [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers other than overwrite confirmation
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable (file existence, content, default behaviors)
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded to CLI prompt and save flow; it does not change existing organized storage semantics beyond using Rich prompts
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified (uses existing `atomic_write_text`, relies on `sys.stdin.isatty()` for TTY detection)
